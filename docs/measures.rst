Measures
========

There two different ways to instantiate a measure. The recommended way to instantiate
a measure object is with a :class:`Decimal<decimal.Decimal>` value
and a :class:`String<str>` unit:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance('1.0', 'm')
    Distance(metre="1.0")

Additionally, you may either pass a string
containing the value and unit separated by a string:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance("1 m")
    Distance(metre="1")

or you can pass the value to the right unit argument:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance(m=1)
    Distance(metre="1")

To concert a measure into another unit you can get the correct unit key:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance("1 m")['ft']
    Decimal('3.280839895013123359580052493')

or attribute:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance("1 m").ft
    Decimal('3.280839895013123359580052493')

.. note::
    Python has restrictions on attribute names.
    E.g. you can not use white spaces:

        >>> from measurement import measures
        >>> measures.Distance(Nautical Mile=1).km
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1
            measures.Distance(Nautical Mile=1).km
                                          ^
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    In this case, you may use underscore instead of spaces:

        >>> from measurement import measures
        >>> measures.Distance(nautical_mile=1).km
        Decimal('1.852')

    or preferably the string version:

        >>> measures.Distance('1 Nautical Mile').km
        Decimal('1.852')

Some Units have `Metric Prefixes`_ like ``kilometre`` or ``kilogram``.
Prefixes are supported for all metric units in their short and long version, e.g:

    >>> from measurement import measures
    >>> measures.Distance('1 Î¼m')['hectometer']
    Decimal('1E-8')

Formatting Output
-----------------

Assuming we have the following two measures, `m` and `n`:

    >>> from measurement.measures import *
    >>> m = Volume("12 litre")
    >>> n = Volume("12.47773243727437659328746732894 litre")

Sometimes decimal values and conversions will result in numbers with many trailing
digits, which is good for calculations, but may not be ideal for display. The
output can easily be formatted with rounding, as in the following examples:

    >>> # Output cubic_in with up to 8 digits in total
    >>> print(f"{m.cubic_in:0.8}")
    732.28493
    >>> # Output cubic_in with only 5 trailing digits, regardless of leading digits
    >>> print(f"{m.cubic_in:.5f}")
    732.28493
    >>> # Output 5 digits, padding with leading zeroes if needed
    >>> print(f"{m:0>5}")
    00012 litre

    >>> print(f"{n}")
    12.47773243727437659328746733 litre
    >>> # Output the measure string value with up to 4 digits in total
    >>> print(f"{n:.4}")
    12.48 litre
    >>> # Output the measure string value with 4 trailing digits
    >>> print(f"{n:.4f}")
    12.4777 litre
